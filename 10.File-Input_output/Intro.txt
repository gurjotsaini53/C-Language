File input output


file  :- container in a storage device to store data

- RAM is volatile
- contents are lost when program terminates
- Files are used to persist the data 




----------------------------------------------------------


Operations on Files
- create a File
- Open a file
- Close a file
- Read from a File
- Write in a File



-----------------------------------------------


Types of File 

Text files ---- .txt , .c , .java

Binary Files --- .exe , .mp3 , .jpg

--------------------------------------------

File Pointer 

File is a  (hidden) structure that needs to be created for opening 
a file 

A file ptr that points to this structure & is used to access the file


FILE *fptr  ;



------------------------------------------------------------------


Opening a file

File *fptr ;  
fptr = fopen("filename",mode);



closing a file 

fclose(fptr);
-----------------------------------------------


File opening modes


"r" - open to Read
"rb" - open to read in binary 
"w" - open to write 
"wb" - open to write in binary
"a" - open to append

-------------------------------------------
Best Practice
check if file exit before reading it 
-------------------------------------------

Reading from a file

char ch ; 
fscanf(fptr,"%c",&ch);

----------------------------------------------------


Writing to a file

char ch = "A"
fprintf(fptr,"%c",ch);


----------------------------------------

Read and write a char

fgetc(fptr);
fputc('A',fptr);



----------------------------------------------


EOF (END OF FILE)


fgetc returns EOF to show that the file has ended
